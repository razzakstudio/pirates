ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
"Inefficiency in Recovering Lost Belongings"

Lost items in public places often remain unclaimed due to poor coordination and tracking. Our task is to bridge the gap between lost and found items through a digital solution.

ðŸ”¹ Our Solution:
We have developed a simple and lightweight Lost & Found Portal using HTML, CSS, and C/C++. 

The portal allows users to:
- Submit lost item reports
- Submit found item reports
- Automatically match lost and found submissions based on item name and location
- Share contact info directly to enable communication between the submitters
